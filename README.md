# Plume
An After Effects script that help you make flexible in and out transitions.
The script adds a little effect on the layer you selected to animate properties that will be played at the beggining and at the end of the layer even if the keyframes are not placed at the right time. Just try it !

## Installation
* Download the zip file with the green button on the top right corner
* Put the jsx file into your ScriptUIPanel folder (on windows, should be something like C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels)
* Open it on After Effects from the "Window" tab

## First time using this script ?
* Select a layer
* Click on "Plumage"
  * It will create expressions for some properties and the Plumage pseudo-effect
* Put some keyframes on a property of the Plumage effect (for example put one keyframe at 0% and one more at 100% on the Opacity IN property)
* Watch your animation playing at the start of your layer even if your keyframes aren't at the same place

Still don't understand because I'm not really good at explaining ?  
I'll put a youtube video to explain it better :)
