# Plume
An After Effects script that help you make flexible in and out transitions.

## Installation
* Download the zip file with the green button on the top right corner
* Put the jsx file into your ScriptUIPanel folder (on windows, should be something like C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels)
* Open it on After Effects from the "Window" tab

## First time using this script ?
* Select a layer
* Click on "Plumage"
  * It will create expressions for some properties and the Plumage pseudo-effect
* Put some keyframes on a property of the Plumage effect (for example put one keyframe at 0% and one more at 100% on the Opacity IN property)
* Watch your animation playing at the start of your layer even if your keyframes aren't at the same place

Still don't understand because I'm not really good at explaining ?  
I'll put a youtube video to explain it better :)
